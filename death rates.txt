"1. Totals are disabled when data are grouped Regions/States, Regions, or States."
"---"
Footnotes:
"1. Zero when no reported cases ? The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC. Not reportable ? The disease or"
"condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction. Unavailable ? The data are"
"unavailable. See Caveats below for more information."
"---"
Caveats:
"1. 'Not Reportable' appears when data is not available for a state for an event in a single year because it was not not"
"reportable."
"2. 'Unavailable' appears when data is not available for a state for an event in a single year because it was unavailable."
"3. 'Not Available' appears when population data is not available due to its removal because event was Not Nationally Notifiable,"
"Not Reportable, or Unavailable."
"4. 'Not Applicable' appears when a rate can not be caluculated due to lack of population."
"5. When the number of cases is zero, the reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC."
"6. When evaluating event case counts over time, you should carefully consider the effect that event case definition revisions"
"(e.g. combining, subsetting, and retirement of events) will have on your query results. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/nndss.html#Reporting."
"7. Acknowledgment: CDC acknowledges the local, state, and territorial health departments that collected the data from a range of"
"case ascertainment sources (e.g. healthcare providers, hospitals, laboratories) and reported these data to CDC's National"
"Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System."
"8. Population estimates for calculating incidence rates are mid-year resident populations for the reporting jurisdictions from"
"the most recent series of estimates available at the time of publication. Congenital syphilis incidence rates are calculated"
"with the number of live births in the reporting jurisdictions for the year. More information:"
"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/nndss.html#Population-Sources."
"9. When the national frequency of a disease is less than 25 cases in a year, then the data for race and ethnicity are"
"categorized as Suppressed. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/nndss.html#Privacy-Policies."
"10. Values in charts and maps refer to statistical measures, such as Case Counts, Populations and Rates. Codes refer to the"
"brief designation assigned to category labels, such as the Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) code 36 for New York"
"State."
